SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Dicates how email should be formatted, encrypted and relayed between mail servers.

IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol
specifies how to communicate with an email providerâ€™s server to retrieve emails sent to your email address.

TLS (port 587) and SSL (port 465) are both types of encryption, to connect to a mail server, we have to
do it using the right encrypting.
