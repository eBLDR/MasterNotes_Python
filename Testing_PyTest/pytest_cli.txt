pytest can be used as test runner for test written using unittest.

To run the tests:
$ pytest <module_name>
<module_name> is optional, pytest will discover files starting with "test_"
that are in or under the current directory.
-v (verbose) to display extra output, showing the progress in %
--sw, --stepwise exit on test failure and continue from last failing test next time
-x, --exitfirst exit instantly on first error or failed test
--durations=N show N slowest setup/test durations (N=0 for all)

pytest-cov plugin integrates coverage, to see the test coverage report:
$ pytest --cov
