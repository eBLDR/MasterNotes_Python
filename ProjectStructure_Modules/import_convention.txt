Order of imports

# Standard library imports
import datetime
import os

# Third party imports
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

# Local application imports
from local_module import local_class
from local_package import local_function

# Is totally fine to import multiple modules in a single line, like so:
import math, random, time
# Though PEP-8 style guide recommends not to do so, and import every module in
# its own line:
import random
import time
from math import pi, pow, sqrt
