Using coverage.py

To gather data, use run command (will by default measure all code, unless
Python Standard Library):
$ coverage run <filename.py> arg1 arg2 ...

...Program's output...

To display the results, use report command:
$ coverage report
-m flag will display lines' number not used.

Creating a HTML/XML template for more detailed information, will create a
folder with all the necessary files:
$ coverage html
$ coverage xml

Excluding lines - any line with a comment of “# pragma: no cover” is excluded.
If that line introduces a clause, for example, an if clause, or a function or
class definition, then the entire clause is also excluded.

Branch coverage measurement, will be more strict thant the normal coverage,
counting strictly each line read as covered (instead of counting the whole
clause as covered, i.e.: if/elif/else - normal coverage will count all the
lines as covered if only one statement is actually executed).
$ coverage run --branch <filename.py> arg1 ...
