Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management,
and it supports multiple programming paradigms.
STATEMENTS are the keywords that Python understands (return, import, pass...).
COMPOUND STATEMENTS are groups of different statements that work together.
They consist of one or more CLAUSES, where a clause consist of a header and a block of code.
Each clause header starts with a keyword, ends with a colon,
and the code is on the same indentation level.
