1. Register the package on PyPi (PyPi account required):

$ python setup.py register

It will:
	- Reserve the name
	- Upload package metadata
	- Create the documentation webpage (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/my_package_name/version


2. Create the source distribution:

$ python setup.py sdist

This will create dist/my_package_name-version.tar.gz inside our top-level directory.


3. Now the dist file can be uploaded to PyPi:

$ python setup.py sdist upload


Steps 1-3 can be combined with:

$ python setup.py register sdist upload


At this point, the package is available for other user using pip:

$ pip install my_package_name
