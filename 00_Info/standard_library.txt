Pythonâ€™s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities.

The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality,
as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many
problems that occur in everyday programming.

Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability
of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.
