ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
	return number

+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	division
//	floor division (ignoring decimals)
%	remainder of the division
**	exponent

====================

COMPARISION OPERATORS - COMPARATORS
	return boolean

>	greater than
<	less than
==	equal to
!=	not equal to (python 2+ could also use <>)
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to

====================

LOGICAL OPERATORS
	return boolean

and	True if both are True
or	True if either is True
not	opposite of the operand

====================

BITWISE OPERATORS
	return a number, works bit by bit

&	AND
|	OR
^	XOR
>>	left shift
<<	right shift
~	NOT (inverted bits)

====================

VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT
	assign values to a variable
	augmented assignment, assigns after operating over itself

=
+=	-=	*=	/=	//=	%=	**=
&=	|=	^=	>>=	<<=

====================

SPECIAL OPERATORS

- IDENTITY

is		True if operands are identical
is not	True if operands are not identical

- MEMBERSHIP

in		True if object is found in the iterable
not in	True if object is not found in the iterable

====================
