There are two types of files: plain text, such as .txt and .py. Can be considered as a string type.
And binary files, which are all the rest (images, pdf, executables, etc).

t  - (default) text mode
b  - binary mode

+  - open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)

r - reading - open for reading only, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file
r+ - reading and writing (cannot truncate a file)

w - writing - open for writing, truncating the file first (overwrites previous data), this mode will create the file if it doesn't exist
w+ - writing and reading (can truncate a file)

a  - appending - appends data the end of the file, the file pointer is at the end of the file, will create a blank file if file not found
a+ - appending and reading

x - exclusive creation - open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists (Python 3)

rb - reading a binary file, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file
rb+ - reading or writing a binary file

wb+ - writing a binary file

ab+ - opens a file for both appending and reading in binary, the file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists, the file opens in the append mode.


default mode is 'rt' (text reading)
