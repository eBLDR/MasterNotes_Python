- Test Fixture
A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests,
and any associate cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating
temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.

- Test Case
A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific
response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class,
TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.

- Test Suite
A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both.
It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.

- Test Runner
A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and
provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface,
a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of
executing the tests.
