To run the test:
$ python -m unittest <module_name>
-v (verbose) flag to display extra output.

To run in discover mode, this will search for all the files in the current
directory with a name starting with 'test' and run them:
$ python -m unittest discover
-s <path> flag allows to specify the name of the directory
The arg `discover` can be removed, it is used by default if path to file was
not provided

To list all unittest options:
$ python -m unittest -h

There are 3 possible outcomes:
    - ok (.) -> test passed
    - FAIL (F) -> test failed, raises and AssertionError exception
    - ERROR (E) -> raises an exception other than AssertionError
